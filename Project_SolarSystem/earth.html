    <p style="font-size: larger">Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. This is enabled by Earth being a water world, <br>
        the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. <br>
        The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within one hemisphere, Earth's land hemisphere. <br>
