    <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. <br>
        It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine-and-a-half times that of Earth. <br> 
        It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive.
